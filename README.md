Develop a BERT-based text classifier for the MahaSent dataset. 
This task involves evaluating and comparing the performance of different models, such as marathi-bert-v2 and indic-bert, 
aiming to match the performance metrics reported in the original paper. Perform comprehensive hyperparameter tuning 
to identify the optimal settings for your model, and document the loss curves and validation accuracy throughout the training epochs.
